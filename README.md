# laminar_flow
This is a laminar boundary layer using OPENFOAM's icoFoam solver
The boundary conditions in the u file are...

we have zeroGradient on the top and bottom of the entrance region
we have constant velocity on the left side of the entrance region
we have zeroGradient on the top of the flat plate region and the right hand side
we have noSlip condition on bottom of the flat plate region





for the future we want to include turbulence modelling
